## Decision Log

### Architectural Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-06-29 | Use Next.js 14 App Router | Modern routing, server components, API routes |
| 2026-06-29 | Mock data first | Faster prototyping, demo-ready, easier testing |
| 2026-06-29 | Custom shadcn-style components | No external dependency, full control |
| 2026-06-29 | Recharts for visualizations | Declarative, React-friendly, good defaults |
| 2026-06-29 | PostgreSQL via Supabase | ACID, real-time, generous free tier |
| 2026-06-29 | Prisma ORM | Type safety, migrations, query building |
| 2026-06-29 | Tailwind 3.4 over 4.0 | Stability, ecosystem compatibility |
| 2026-06-29 | Vercel hosting | Zero-config Next.js, edge functions |

### Scope Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Internal-only (no patient portal) | Focus on team efficiency, patient data sensitivity |
| 9 main modules | Balance between comprehensive and not overwhelming |
| Mock data initially | Allows full UI/UX validation before database work |
| No mobile app yet | Web responsive is sufficient for v1 |
| Single-tenant | No multi-organization complexity yet |

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Mock Data** — All data is in-memory, not persisted
2. **No Authentication** — Open access (development only)
3. **No Real-time** — Updates require page refresh
4. **No File Upload** — Documents are listed, not uploaded
5. **No Email/WhatsApp Integration** — Manual processes
6. **Static API Responses** — Routes return mock data, not from DB

### Future Bugs / Tech Debt

- API routes use `Promise<{ id: string }>` for params (Next.js 15 compatibility) — verify when upgrading
- Mobile sidebar auto-closes on route change but not on outside click
- Form validation is HTML5 only (no client-side zod)
- Charts have no data fetching optimization
